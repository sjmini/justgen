# JUSTGen 

This repository provides the tool for the paper "JUSTGen: Effective Test Generation for Unspecified JNI Behaviors on JVMs" accepted at ICSE 2021.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Ocaml version 4.08.1
* Opam 2.0.5
* z3.4.8.1

### Building

1. clone the source code
```
git clone https://github.com/sjmini/justgen.git
```
2. build the source code via make command
```
make
```
slang.exe file will be generated.

### Executing JUSTGen 
JUSTGen can be executed by running slang.exe file.
JUSTGen consists of two phase; 1) Finding unspecified cases in JNI specification 2) Generating test programs triggering the behaviors of identified unspecified cases.

#### Finding Unspecified Cases in JNI Specification

Run the JUSTGen through <i>find_unspec</i> option.

```
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<z3 path>.opam/default/lib/z3/
./slang.exe find_unspec |tee unspec_dsl
```
By running above commands, JUSTGen finds unspecified cases and summaized the unspecified cases in unspec_dsl file

#### Generating Test Programs

Run the JUSTGen through <i>gen_program</i> option. 

Note that the unspec_dsl file must be generated by running <i>find_unspec</i> option before executing the JUSTGen with <i>gen_program</i> option.
```
./slang.exe gen_program |tee gen_result
```
By running above command, JUSTGen generates test programs triggering the behaviors of unspecified cases in the unspec_dsl file.
The test programs will be placed in test_case folder.
